**Program Description**

This program takes in a range of numbers and displays all the prime numbers within that range. A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no other factors except 1 and itself

**Program Logic**

1. The program prompts the user to enter the lower and upper limits of the range.
2. It then iterates through each number in the range.
3. For each number, it checks if it is greater than 1.
4. If the number is greater than 1, it checks if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.
5. If the number is found to be prime, it is printed to the console.

**The implementation of Python code to display all prime numbers within a specific range can be useful within a company for various purposes, such as:**

1. Data analysis: This program can be used to analyze data within a certain range and identify prime numbers within that range. For instance, if a company wants to analyze sales data within a specific time frame, this program can assist in identifying prime numbers within that range.

2. Security: This program can be utilized to generate prime numbers used in cryptography and information security. For example, a company can use prime numbers to generate strong encryption keys for safeguarding sensitive data.

3. Software development: This program can be employed as a part of software development involving prime numbers. For instance, if a company is developing software for mathematical or computer science purposes, this program can help in finding the required prime numbers.

The implementation of Python code to display all prime numbers within a specific range can be beneficial across various aspects of business and technology within the company.
